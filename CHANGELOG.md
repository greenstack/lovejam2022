# Magna 2.0
- Added a massive quake ability to evil crystals. After 30 seconds, the crystals will emit a shockwave that covers the map.
- Increased Magna's move speed from 200 to 300.
- Gave Evil Crystals a cool warp visualization (entirely on purpose and not on accident).
- Magna's speed gets cut in half when charging a quake
- Quakes can be cancelled by pressing `z` or `left shift`
- `Return/Enter` can now be used to initiate a quake
