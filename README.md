# GreenstackJ's LÃ¶veJam 2022 Entry
_Magna_ is an arcade-style game where you play as the eponymous Magna as she
tries to protect her cave from the evil invading crystals.

The game was originally made during the 2022 LoveJam on itch.io.

## Gameplay
Move with the WASD keys.  
Press and hold X to charge an earthquake. Release the X to fire it off.  
If all the green crystals are destroyed, it's game over!  
Suvive as long as you can and try to get the high score.

# Installation
Requires Love 11.3+. The .vscode folder has settings to make running and
debugging easier; the info for how to set this up is available [here][SheepArticle].
(You only need to install the listed extensions for the time being.)

Clone the repo with the `--recursive` flag.
